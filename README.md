# Norinori using Honey Badger Algorithm and Q-Learning

## About the Project
The project involves developing an agent that implements the Honey Badger Algorithm and Q-Learning to solve a logic puzzle called Norinori.
The agent will preprocess the data using strategies discovered previously, and then implement the algorithm to obtain the final solution to the puzzle.
The puzzle's data is obtained from https://www.puzzle-norinori.com/ using web scraping.

> This project is a part of my thesis.
